//TODO: tweak controller AI so that she tries to stay away and spawn broodlings until she can't anymore, then charge
//        maybe can define spawning a broodling as a ranged weapon of sorts. LOOK AT THE UT2004 REF for skaarjpack.monstercontroller

//        maybe tweak the reference's FindNewEnemy functionality to see what distance / visibility is between broodmother and players and react accordingly
//        maybe utilize LineOfSightTo(something) function as shown in SetEnemy()
//        also check out engine.controller for MoveToward() and such functionality- controls how actor faces while moving to

// LOL!!! Use WasKilledBy from engine.controller to make My remaining Broodlings AVENGE ME!!!

// maybe use controller.PlayerCanSeeMe()- returns true if any player can see me- native code so fast!
