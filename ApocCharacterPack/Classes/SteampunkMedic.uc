     TextName="No one thought David would make a good doctor, which is why he was rejected by every medical school in the country. Imagine his surprise and delight when the Horzine mutant problem erupted, allowing any lunatic with a scalpel and some bandages to call themselves a medic. David now roams the streets, helping the wounded and vanquishing the undead ï¿½ though sometimes he gets the two a bit mixed up."
