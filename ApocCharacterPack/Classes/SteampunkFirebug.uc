     TextName="The purifying power of flame has long fascinated Adam, a quirk that drove him in and out of foster homes and eventually every prison north of the Thames. But his passion never waned and, while feeding his hunger, Adam refined his skills and forged a reputation as the worldï¿½s foremost pyromaniac for hire. The Horzine disaster drew our hero homeward and now Adam finds himself on the streets of London dishing out his own unique brand of fiery pain for free."
